workplan(each needs to work):

0) test work on yago. make sure what happens with Named Enttities/collocs(new york)
1) Datasets:
-old reuters, ModApte split (9603 train, 3299 test, 2 category sets, 10 largest categories)
-new reuters, some subset since full is 800K docs. (17808 train from same day, 5341 test same day, 16 topics/ondustry categories or 10)
-OHSUMED, some subset since full is 300K docs, 1991 papers with abstracts. (10,00 train, 10,000 test, see gab work on how categories...)
-20 newsgroups (20 categories, 1000 docs each. use cross validation 4 or 5 folds)
-TECH TC

start with 20 and old reuters and maybe tech TC
***look at sameAs and lookup linker(lookup.dbpedia.org) for alt names...some other NER mechanic?

moar datasets for techTC: ->not really needed! all in yago, though maybe want to subdivide relations in yago for better granularity(like located_in which has towns, countries, contnients)
good options: dbtune (music db, huge, musicBrains is nice subset), linkedMDB(movie db, big), telegraphis(country, capital,continent,currency)
others: dbpedia (general knowledge, hard to use), crunchbase,wikicompany(companies+products, currently offline), FAO geopolitical(eurostat but better, has borders,groupings=continent+region)
some other cool things: data.gov (many many datasets! generally hard to use as facts...), eurostat(european country+region data, hard to use as facts here), freebase(dataset of many many things, super hard to use...), new york times DB(links thing to NYT articles, hard to use), uniprot(proteins data)

OHSUMED structure:
*no good separation stuff: neurologic sequelae, bacterial meningitis, epilepsy, sensorineural hearing loss. modifiers like "acute","late" which may or may not be important
*harder stuff like: generalized tonic-clonic seizures (seizures->seizure, prefix mby important), Cysticercus antibody(???), Estrogen deficiency that comes with menopause(can get partial?)
*worse: retroperitoneal tumors with large vena caval thrombi, deep hypothermic circulatory arrest, renal pelvic transitional cell carcinoma
*: Treatment of Fournier's gangrene with adjunctive hyperbaric oxygen therapy (Fournier gangrene, adjunctive hyperbaric oxygen therapy)
*: recombinant human interferon-alpha 2a or human lymphoblastoid interferon-alpha n1 and concomitant zidovudine(recombinant human interferon-alpha 2a, human lymphoblastoid interferon-alpha n1, concomitant zidovudine)
*: AIDS-related Kaposi's sarcoma (wtf level phrase)

*****stemming is plural->singular things (xxxs->xxx, xxxies->xxxy) and xxx's->xxx (alzheimer's,wegner's,etc)
*****most of these words are not commonly used, could use commons as seperators?

OHSUMED data strategy:
--joachim dataset(the popular one) is only cardio-vascular disease(heart and blood system). need disease and treatment mostly
-dbpedia has mostly useless sidebar data for diseases/interventions(treatment)->mesh entry links to Annotation(text summary),medline+ gives some description(links in article could be good?)
also-you do have abstracts(summary), and can get the actual article. maybe could use the links inside as a guide?

-diseaseome has disease->(associated genes,subclass of). used as labels to connect others. genes have disease connect only
-sider has drug side effects
-linkedCT has disease->clinical trial(abstract+content+keywords,treatment(intervention),which country done). can go by country...also has medical people and sponsors
-dailyMed has data on drugs (what disease is for,drug family group, who makes it) and organizations (what drugs produce, 
-drugbank has data on drugs (description, on what used(mammal,human,...),indication(purpose),how works,dbpedia link, possible disease to use, state(liquid/solid)) and also how pairs interact

-bio2rdf seems to have mostly gene->human,mouse interaction,proteins,and all sorts of the crap...
-no need for "linked neuron data" here (overkill)->connect structure, disease to part, and much more
