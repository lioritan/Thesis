Things to do:

Alg:
- fix bruteforce w/sampling so that it's not slow + compare
- speed up info_gain (largest bottleneck)
- try implement AIC/BIC.number of params?(problem dim+num of splits?)
- implement anytime version. mby weighting by (featuresAdded+1)/(featuresTried+1)
- implement+compare ESA

- use iterative deepening? is that a good idea? no validation set...
- tree export to pdf: need pydot+graphviz, string representation

Data:
- build OHSUMED titles only: right now too few docs per category, need to manually find all top level categories and use those...
- YAGO data mby expand: sameAS/event data/numeric relations. increase relation granularity? more databases?
- linkedCT condition->intervention? 
- reuters? 20NG? techTC300?

Proposal:
- deadline: as soon as possible 
- finish pass on chap3, go over chap1+2, draw the tree in intro example
