Things to do:

Alg:
- fix bruteforce and compare! do FG once offline using ~furnkrantz? need to also compare to 1 step alg7/8 and then state-of-art...- implement+compare ESA
- implement ESA-FG
- using linkedCT for medical data? using conceptnet/freebase instead of yago?
- try implement AIC/BIC.number of params?(problem dim+num of splits?)
- implement anytime version. mby weighting by (featuresAdded+1)/(featuresTried+1)
- some pre-pruning based on confidence?
- 
-what about non-binary features in general (avg instead of majority?)

Data:
- YAGO data mby expand: sameAS/event data/numeric relations. increase relation granularity? more databases? use conceptnet/freebase instead?
- linkedCT condition->intervention? 
- reuters? 20NG? techTC300?
