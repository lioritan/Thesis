Things to do:

Alg:
- do multiclass instead of all v all binary: need to do: IG->ratio, map of sons. fix statistic test, relabel, train, predict. How do you use the old binary "word_in" features?
-cross validation on whether to go deeper (do k fold cross val/leave one out, try deeper vs. non deeper and choose majority decision)->no need to split node, right?
- fix bruteforce w/sampling so that it's not slow + compare
- implement+compare ESA
- try implement AIC/BIC.number of params?(problem dim+num of splits?)
- implement anytime version. mby weighting by (featuresAdded+1)/(featuresTried+1)

- tree export to pdf: need pydot+graphviz, string representation

Data:
- YAGO data mby expand: sameAS/event data/numeric relations. increase relation granularity? more databases? use conceptnet instead?
- linkedCT condition->intervention? 
- reuters? 20NG? techTC300?

Proposal:
- deadline: as soon as possible 
- finish pass on chap3, go over chap1+2, draw the tree in intro example
