Things to do:

Alg:
- new formulation? explore collective classification, link propagation,graph kernels. use weigthing by tfidf for majority label? do this in advance for feature gen, then table?
- mby switch outer tree with boosting? (boosting on several recursive trees)
- fix bruteforce and compare! do FG once offline using ~furnkrantz? need to also compare to 1 step alg and then state-of-art...- implement+compare ESA
- implement ESA-FG
- using linkedCT for medical data? using conceptnet/freebase instead of yago?
- implement anytime version. mby weighting by (featuresAdded+1)/(featuresTried+1)
-what about non-binary features in general (avg instead of majority?)
- can potentially branch&bound instead of sampling? Cheng H, Yan X, Han J, Yu PS (2008) Direct discriminative pattern mining for effective classification

Data:
- YAGO data mby expand: sameAS/event data/numeric relations. increase relation granularity? more databases? use conceptnet/freebase instead?
- linkedCT condition->intervention? 
- techTC300 instead of 100
- 20 NG full
- OHSUMED full
- reuters?
